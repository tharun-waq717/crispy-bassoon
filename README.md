Machine learning (ML) algorithms are a set of methods or processes that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. There are several types of machine learning algorithms, categorized based on how they learn from the data. Here are the main categories and some common algorithms under each:

1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is already known. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a certain class.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes.

Decision Trees: A tree-like structure where each node represents a decision, and the leaves represent class labels or continuous values.

Random Forests: An ensemble of decision trees that improves performance and reduces overfitting.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, often used for text classification.

2. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm works with unlabeled data and tries to identify hidden patterns or structures.

K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into k clusters based on similarity.

Hierarchical Clustering: Builds a tree of clusters and doesn't require the user to specify the number of clusters beforehand.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space.

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): A probabilistic model that assumes all data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.

3. Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or punishments). The goal is to learn the optimal policy to maximize cumulative rewards.

Q-Learning: A model-free algorithm that learns the value of actions in a given state, aiming to find the optimal policy.
